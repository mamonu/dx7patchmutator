2.1.2 (20130206)
Renata Dokmanovic says goodbye to the Yahoo YamahaDX forum.
She has helped many DX users and has had an important role during the development
of DX/TXconvert. This release is dedicated to her:
- -R or --Renata commandline option is a shortcut for --random=0
- 3rd party news: the official python-rtmidi-0.3.1a (or newer) downloads from
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi/
  should now work nicely with DX/TXconvert, also on Windows.
- MIDI in the GUI version gives mysterious problems, if run by pythonw.exe on Windows.
  They are now named dxconvert-gui.py and txconvert-gui.py again. (reported by Paul Deco)
- bugfix: unassigned variable "channel" when no channel selected in GUI.

2.1.1 (20130122)
- use extended/undocumented FB01 transpose range to compensate octave shifts after conversions
- less octave transpositions after converting from TX81Z (etc.) to DX21/27/100
- fixed a bug when rtmidi is not available. (reported and fixed by W. Cruz)

2.1.0 (201212120)
- new: Export to FB01 (TXconvert)
- improved: TX81Z > DX21 operator frequency conversion
- bugfix: FB01 > DX7 conversion OP1 level=0, not 99 
- improved: AMD parameter conversion dx7/4op/fb01
- bugfix: MIDI output in txconvert-gui.py
- improved: MIDI output reliability
- fixed deprecated --version argument
- fixed bug in 4-op parameter print
- improved: MIDI configuration dialog initialized with values from dxtxmidi.cfg,
  or with values from environment variables 'MID_IN' and 'MID_OUT'

- Some code cleanup

2.0.11 (20121011)
- Fixed really bad bug in txconvert
- Implemented Renata Dokmanovic randomizing algorithm (thanks R.!)
  (Usage: --random with value 0)

2.0.10 (20121007)
- order of excution of options changed:
    --select --find --random --nodupes --sort
  
2.0.9 (20121003)

2.0.7 (20120830)
- pygame.midi / pyportmidi was giving me headaches. 
  DX/TXconvert now uses python-rtmidi for the MIDI functions.
  Download it here:    
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi/
    http://chrisarndt.de/projects/python-rtmidi/download/
- Intelligent recalculation of TX81Z (and newer) operator frequencies 
  when converting for use with DX100/27/21.
- Fixed frequencies can be converted to ratios for use with DX100/27/21. 
  Approximation is based on middle E.
- Various ways to select MIDI I/O ports:
  MID_IN and MID_OUT can be set using environment variables.
  MID_IN and MID_OUT can be set using commandline options 
  MID_IN and MID_OUT can be set in the GUI version
  MID_IN and MID_OUT are saved in a file named "dxtxmidi.cfg"
  this will all override pre-defined strings in DXconvert/dxcommon.py
- fixed broken --select functions
- MIDI configuration GUI.
  
2.0.6 (20120817)
- Optimized input file format detection. 
- Randomizer default value=0. Fixes a crash that happens with Python 3

- bumped version number from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2

2.0.0 (20120624)
